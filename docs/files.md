Flocon allows you to explore the **internal file storage** of your Android application — something that typically requires ADB and knowledge of Android's file system.

From the desktop app, you can:

- Browse directories within the app's sandbox
- View file metadata (size, modification date, path)
- Open or download files for inspection

This feature is ideal for inspecting log files, cache data, downloaded assets, or exported config files.
