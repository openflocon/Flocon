## 🐶 Why the name "Flocon" ✨ ?

I was looking for a short, cute animal-inspired name — something in the spirit of "Flipper".  
I turned my head and saw my golden retriever, Flocon, smiling to me... and that was it. 
That was all the inspiration I needed.  

No brainstorming, no hesitation — just the perfect name at the perfect time.
