Flocon provides complete access to your app’s **SharedPreferences**, which often store user tokens, feature flags, configuration options, and more.

Key capabilities include:

- Browsing all preference files
- Viewing and filtering key-value pairs
- Inspecting primitive values and JSON structures
- **Editing values on the fly** from the desktop UI

This is an extremely powerful way to test different user scenarios or simulate app states, without needing to rebuild the app or manually trigger edge cases.
