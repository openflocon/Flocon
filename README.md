# üêï Flocon

**Flocon** is an advanced debugging and inspection tool for Android applications, inspired by [Flipper](https://github.com/facebook/flipper) by Meta.

It allows developers to connect an Android device to their computer and launch a desktop interface that can **observe, inspect, and interact with the running mobile app** in real time.

With Flocon, you gain deep access to critical app internals ‚Äî such as network requests, local storage, analytics events, and more ‚Äî without needing root access or tedious ADB commands. It‚Äôs designed to accelerate development, QA, and debugging workflows.

## üöÄ What Can Flocon Do?

Once your Android device is connected and your app includes the Flocon SDK, you can use the desktop companion app to access the following features:

---

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

in your module .kts
```
// use only on a debug buildType, do not distribute on the playstore build !
debugImplementation("io.github.openflocon:flocon:0.0.1")
```

in your `Application.kt`
```
Flocon.initialize(this)
```

### üì° Network Request Inspector

<img width="1200" height="780" alt="Network1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc7aeead-33e8-4ca4-8572-58607edc26c6" />
<img width="1199" height="774" alt="Network2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63725cda-4e21-4f0f-b5a9-53d2e3c46b26" />


Flocon captures **all outgoing network requests** made by the Android app ‚Äî whether they‚Äôre simple REST API calls or complex multipart uploads ‚Äî and displays them in an organized UI.

For each request, you can inspect:

- HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
- Full URL
- Request headers and body
- Response headers and body
- Status code and response time
- Timestamp

This feature is invaluable for diagnosing backend issues, debugging unexpected API failures, and verifying request payloads and authentication headers.

```
debugImplementation("io.github.openflocon:flocon-okhttp-interceptor:0.0.1")
```

```
val okHttpClient = OkHttpClient()
            .newBuilder()
            .addInterceptor(FloconOkhttpInterceptor())
            .build()
```

### üñºÔ∏è Downloaded Image Viewer

<img width="1204" height="769" alt="Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2025-07-30 aÃÄ 08 09 56" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f85fdd00-4ddf-4978-9e83-ab6007ddc2c0" />

Flocon captures and displays **images downloaded by the Android app**, giving you a clear, visual representation of media fetched over the network ‚Äî such as avatars, product thumbnails, banners, or any other images requested at runtime.

For each image, Flocon shows:

- A live **thumbnail preview** of the image  
- The **URL** from which it was downloaded
- The **download timestamp**  

This feature is extremely useful for:

- Verifying that images are loading correctly and not broken  
- Debugging CDN issues, placeholders, or misconfigured URLs  
- Comparing image quality and compression at runtime  
- Inspecting lazy loading or image caching behaviors  

Whether you're working on UI/UX, performance optimization, or just debugging a missing image, this tool gives you **immediate visibility** into every image fetched by your app.

Usage with coil
```
// just add your okhttp client (with the flipper interceptor)
SingletonImageLoader.setSafe {
        ImageLoader.Builder(context = context)
            .components {
                add(
                    coil3.network.okhttp.OkHttpNetworkFetcherFactory(
                        callFactory = {
                            okHttpClient
                        },
                    ),
                )
            }
            .build()
}
```

### üìä Analytics Event Viewer
<img width="1196" height="774" alt="Analytics" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f485b4e-874b-4fdc-afab-752c4cd1ea3a" />

Flocon shows a real-time stream of **analytics events** emitted by your application. Whether you‚Äôre using Firebase Analytics, Segment, or a custom solution, the Flocon SDK can be plugged and forward these events to the desktop UI.

Each event includes:

- The event name
- Parameters and metadata
- Timestamps

This is especially useful for QA teams and product analysts to validate that the right events are triggered at the right time, with the correct payloads.

```
Flocon.analytics("firebase").logEvents(
     AnalyticsEvent(
         eventName = "clicked user",
         "userId" analyticsProperty "1024",
         "username" analyticsProperty "florent",
         "index" analyticsProperty "3",
    ),
    AnalyticsEvent(
         eventName = "opened profile",
         "userId" analyticsProperty "2048",
         "username" analyticsProperty "kevin",
         "age" analyticsProperty "34",
    ),
```

### üìà Configurable Dashboards (from the mobile app)

<img width="1203" height="770" alt="Dashboards" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d918c15c-72b2-412c-b97f-a409dcdf1737" />

Your Android application can define and expose **custom dashboards**, which Flocon renders dynamically in the desktop interface.

Use cases include:

- Displaying live business metrics
- Monitoring app state variables
- Debugging real-time values (e.g., geolocation, battery, app mode)
- Real time in-app variables editions
- Perform from the desktop app mobile callbacks

Dashboards are defined programmatically on the mobile side via the SDK, and they update live as data changes ‚Äî making them ideal for live demos, QA testing, or in-field diagnostics.

---

### üìã Configurable Data Tables

<img width="1196" height="768" alt="tables" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff3090fa-8f37-4138-a492-20b9159314af" />

In addition to dashboards, Flocon supports structured **data tables** that can be configured and updated by the mobile app.

These tables can be used to visualize:

- Lists of active users
- Items in memory or cache
- Custom logs or metrics
- Backend response simulations

Tables are interactive, scrollable, and they give developers and testers a straightforward way to inspect lists or collections in real time.

To create a dynamic row :
```
Flocon.table("analytics").log(
   "name" toParam "nameValue",
   "value1" toParam "value1Value",
   "value2" toParam "value2Value",
)
```

Flocon includes a **deeplink runner**, which lists all the deeplinks supported by your app (either auto-discovered or manually registered).

From the desktop UI, you can:

- Browse available deeplinks
- Enter parameters interactively
- Execute deeplinks directly on the device
- Instantly navigate to specific app screens

No more typing long `adb shell am start` commands ‚Äî Flocon makes deeplink testing accessible and efficient.

**You can configure deeplinks directly from your android code !**
```
Flocon.deeplinks(
        listOf(
            Deeplink("flocon://home"),
            Deeplink("flocon://test"),
            Deeplink(
                "flocon://user/[userId]",
                label = "User"
            ),
            Deeplink(
                "flocon://post/[postId]?comment=[commentText]",
                label = "Post",
                description = "Open a post and send a comment"
